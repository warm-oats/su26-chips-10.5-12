Feature: Accessibility
    So that all users can use our app, and we do not get sued,
    all pages should meet full accessibility standards.

# Accessibility Testing Relies on a Gem Called 'axe'
# axe uses JavaScript to audit pages for compliance with web standards.
# See https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-gems/blob/develop/packages/axe-core-cucumber/README.md

## These tests are excluded by default when running cucumber (see config/cucumber.yml)
#  Run cucumber -p a11y to run the 'a11y' profile
